# 🧬 Biotech Go-to-market and Pipeline Growth
Repositioned a niche biotech solution as an enterprise-scale climate asset, accelerating enterprise deals and investor traction.

**Client:** Series B French biotech startup (insect-based protein, 60+ employees)  
**Objective:** Increase investor confidence and accelerate enterprise deal flow in a conservative, risk-sensitive market.

### 1. The Challenge
Enterprise buyers and late-stage investors hesitated due to **perceived category risk and scalability uncertainty**. The solution was seen as experimental rather than deployable at scale, and messaging across channels was inconsistent, slowing pipeline progression and investor engagement.

---

### 2. Strategy
**Enterprise Lead Acquisition & Account-Based Marketing (ABM)**

To address perceived category risk and demonstrate scalability, I designed a **multi-channel ABM strategy** targeting enterprise accounts and late-stage investors. Each touchpoint reinforced **climate impact, scalability, and alternative protein positioning** while keeping messaging consistent with audience expectations.

**Channels:**
* LinkedIn account targeting and credibility campaigns
* Segmented email sequences
* Webinars
* PR and partner outreach

**Tools:**
* HubSpot (CRM and lead qualification)
* Google Analytics 4 (GA4)
* ConvertKit
* GoToWebinar

**Methods:**
* ABM workflows
* Lead acquisition funnels
* A/B testing
* Performance optimization

---

### 3. Execution
* Built ABM workflows for investors, partners, and enterprise accounts  
* Created thought leadership assets: founder webinars, gated reports, case briefs  
* Launched LinkedIn credibility campaigns with tailored messaging  
* Led PR and partner outreach using a climate-scale narrative
* Built CRM dashboards to track attribution and pipeline velocity
