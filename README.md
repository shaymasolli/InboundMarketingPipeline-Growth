# üß¨ Biotech Go-to-market and Pipeline Growth
Repositioned a niche biotech solution as an enterprise-scale climate asset, accelerating enterprise deals and investor traction.

**Client:** Series B multinational biotech startup (insect-based protein)  
**Objective:** Increase investor confidence and accelerate enterprise deal flow in a conservative, risk-sensitive market.

---

### 1. The Challenge
Enterprise buyers and late-stage investors hesitated due to **perceived category risk and scalability uncertainty**. The solution was perceived as experimental rather than deployable at scale. Inconsistent messaging across channels further slowed investor engagement and deal progression.

---

### 2. Strategy
**Enterprise Lead Acquisition & Account-Based Marketing (ABM)**

To counteract perceived risk and build confidence in scalability, I designed a **multi-channel ABM strategy** targeting enterprise buyers and late-stage investors. Each touchpoint reinforced **climate impact, industrial readiness and alternative protein positioning**, using consistent narratives across channels.

**Channels:**
* LinkedIn account targeting and credibility campaigns
* Segmented email sequences
* Webinars
* PR and partner outreach

**Tools:**
* HubSpot (CRM and lead qualification)
* Google Analytics 4 (GA4)
* ConvertKit
* GoToWebinar

**Methods:**
* ABM workflows
* Lead acquisition funnels
* A/B testing
* Performance optimization

### 3. Execution
* Built ABM workflows for investors, partners and enterprise accounts  
* Produced thought leadership content: founder webinars, gated reports, case briefs  
* Launched LinkedIn credibility campaigns with tailored positioning  
* Led PR and partner outreach using a climate-scale narrative
* Built CRM dashboards to track attribution and pipeline velocity
