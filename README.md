# ðŸ§¬ Biotech Go-to-market and Pipeline Growth

Repositioned a niche biotech solution as an enterprise-scale climate asset, accelerating enterprise deals and investor traction.

**Client:** Series B French biotech startup (insect-based protein, 60+ employees)  
**Objective:** Increase investor confidence and accelerate enterprise deal flow in a conservative, risk-sensitive market.

## 1. The Challenge

Enterprise buyers and late-stage investors hesitated due to perceived category risk and scalability uncertainty. The solution was seen as experimental rather than deployable at scale, and messaging across channels was inconsistent, slowing pipeline progression and investor engagement.

## 2. Strategy

**Enterprise Lead Acquisition & Account-Based Marketing (ABM)**  

To address perceived category risk and demonstrate scalability, I designed a multi-channel ABM strategy targeting enterprise accounts and late-stage investors. Each touchpoint reinforced climate impact, scalability, and alternative protein positioning while keeping messaging consistent with audience expectations.

* **Channels:** LinkedIn account targeting and credibility campaigns, segmented email, webinars, PR/partner outreach  
* **Tools:** HubSpot (CRM and lead qualification), Google Analytics 4, ConvertKit, GoToWebinar  
* **Methods:** ABM workflows, lead acquisition funnels, A/B testing, performance optimization  

I executed integrated campaigns combining ABM workflows, PR outreach, webinars, and targeted content to engage accounts, capture qualified leads, and accelerate late-stage pipeline movement.

## 4. Results

* $5M+ late-stage enterprise and investor pipeline generated over Q1â€“Q2 from ABM-targeted accounts, advancing 3 strategic partnership proposals and accelerating deal cycles by ~25%  
* Engaged 60+ high-value accounts (enterprise + investors), prioritized by company size, funding stage, and sustainability mandate  
* Investor traction: Follow-ups and scheduled meetings with 3 sustainability-focused funds and 2 corporate VCs, demonstrating increased investor confidence  
* Digital and content contribution: LinkedIn campaigns, webinars, and gated content accounted for ~30% of pipeline acceleration, with CTR ~5% and ~2,000+ content interactions  
* Full-funnel attribution and pipeline stage velocity tracked in HubSpot for transparent monitoring of lead and investor progression

## 5. Key Insight

The primary barrier was market validation and positioning, not demand. Reframing the solution as climate-scale infrastructure reduced perceived risk, accelerated enterprise deals, and increased investor readiness.
